## IT Inventory

There are two really difficult problems in IT management that don't get the respect they deserve - the first is identity management and this article is about the other - Inventory. I know a little about identity management and highly respect the people that work in that space. I know quite a bit more about inventory.

My point of view on inventory is as a long-time Unix systems administrator and project lead on the ITAM (IT Asset Management - the formal name for "computer inventory") system at my current job. I identified the original lack and put the project together and maintain it still. When I set out to write this I outlined what I wanted to write and ... it was WAY too much to be a single blog article. So this is going to be a category and I'm going to try and group things logically.

I'll start with a teaser - the most important thing to always remember is the inventory system needs to serve the needs of the organization - and not the other way around.
