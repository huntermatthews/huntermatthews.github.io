# About me

Hello. I'm Hunter Matthews and I'm a Unix systems administrator and automation
engineer. I've worked at universities, major fortune 10 corporations and others. The common link in most of my jobs has been working for biologists doing genetics.

My hobbies outside computers include fountain pen collecting, getting an older Miata back on the road and I spent 6 years doing photography in the Chicago theater scene. In past years I road motorcycles for relaxation - I miss my bikes.

The frequency which I post here is open to question - I have opinions! But I don't always have the time or drive to post them online.

# Colonphon

This site is a simple static site created with hugo and markdown files. I do system administration all day so part of the sites goal was to be (relatively) simple to setup and keep running.

The name was hard to come up with - but mine IS the house that Unix built (mostly linux but I've done HP-UX, Solaris and even ESIX and Xenix...)

Welcome.
